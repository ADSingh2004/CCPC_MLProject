# Project Overview
This project aims to create a predictive analytics system to forecast the effects of
climate change on farming productivity and offer optimised farming techniques to
reduce negative impacts. The system will analyse historical climate data, soil info,
crop yield records, and satellite images to make predictions and suggestions.

# Key Objectives
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
  ● Get old weather data (like temperature, rain, humidity) from weather
databases.
  ● Gather soil details (pH, nutrients, moisture) and crop yield records from agri
databases.
  ● Use satellite images to study vegetation (NDVI).
2. Climate Impact Prediction :
  ● Make ML models to predict future climates through time analysis.
  ● Create models to see how predicted climates will affect crop yields.
4. Optimization of Farming Practices :
  ● Use AI methods to suggest best planting times, watering schedules, and
crops based on expected climate changes.
  ● Make a support system for farmers to adjust their practices according to
climate changes.
6. Visualisation and User Interface :
  ● Develop a simple dashboard for farmers showing climate forecasts, crop yield
estimates, and recommended actions.
  ● Show interactive maps with local climate predictions and suggested farming
methods.

# Tools and Technologies :
  ● Data Collection: Python, APIs, web scraping, satellite imagery tools
  ● Data Analysis and Modeling: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow,
Keras
  ● Optimization: SciPy, PyGAD (genetic algorithm library)
  ● Visualisation: D3.js, Plotly, Dash, or Tableau, matplotlib
  ● Deployment: Flask/Django for backend, React for frontend, AWS/Azure/GCP
for cloud deployment

# Conclusion :
In wrapping up, climate change is quite a challenge for agriculture. However, with a
well-rounded method involving technology, policy assistance, sustainable methods,
and global teamwork, we can reduce its effects and create a sturdy agricultural
industry. By centering on adaptive approaches, using machine learning for
forecasting, and encouraging cooperation, the farming community can handle the
uncertainties brought by climate change and secure food supply for the next
generations
